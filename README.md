Instagram Challenge
===================

## Instructions

* Challenge time: one weekend
* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc., but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!

# Instagram Challenge

This is my version of the Instagram weekend challenge completed at the end of week 8 of the Makers course. The task was to build a clone of Instagram using Rails in two days. The clone needed to have **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** and **like** a picture.  

## Getting Started

To get started, clone a copy of this repository using:

```ruby
git clone https://github.com/andyk144/instagram-challenge.git
```

### Installing

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to it using

```ruby
cd instagram-challenge
```

Then run
```ruby
bundle install
```
This will install all of the necessary Ruby Gem's required to run the program.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

To run the tests, whilst in the root folder of your application, enter the command ```rspec```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
